keyframes - position of elemtns over a time
x vs y
position vs time
2s vs 10%, 20%, 30%

ease-in will start the animation slowly, and finish at full speed.
ease-out will start the animation at full speed, then finish slowly.
ease-in-out will start slowly, be fastest at the middle of the animation, then finish slowly.
ease is like ease-in-out, except it starts slightly faster than it ends.
linear uses no easing.

all -> all type of tranisition like scal, background-color, opacity etc..


CSS provides several properties to control animations. Here are some key ones:

- **`animation-name`**: Specifies the name of the `@keyframes` animation.
- **`animation-duration`**: Specifies the duration of the animation.
- **`animation-timing-function`**: Specifies the speed curve of the animation (e.g., `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`).
- **`animation-delay`**: Specifies a delay before the animation starts.
- **`animation-iteration-count`**: Specifies the number of times the animation should repeat (e.g., `infinite`).
- **`animation-direction`**: Specifies whether the animation should play forwards, backwards, or alternate between both.
- **`animation-fill-mode`**: Specifies how a CSS animation should apply styles to its target before and after it is executing (e.g., `forwards`, `backwards`, `both`).
- **`animation-play-state`**: Specifies whether the animation is running or paused.
