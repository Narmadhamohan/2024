ease-in will start the animation slowly, 
and finish at full speed.

ease-out will start the animation at full speed,
 then finish slowly.


ease-in-out will start slowly, 
be fastest at the middle of the animation, 
then finish slowly.


ease is like ease-in-out, 
except it starts slightly faster than it ends.
linear uses no easing.
