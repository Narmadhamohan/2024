Most programming languages have many number types:

Whole numbers (integers):
byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

Real numbers (floating-point):
float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

Javascript numbers are always one type:
double (64-bit floating point).

typeof

Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)


Why Functions?
With functions you can reuse code

You can write code that can be used many times.

You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results. 	

Note
As you see from the examples above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.

function addTwoNumbers(a,b){

return a+b;
}



const funVar = addTwoNumbers;
